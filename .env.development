# WaterLab LIMS - Local Development Environment Variables
# This file is intended for local development.
# Rename this file to ".env" in your project root for it to be loaded by python-decouple.
# The start_dev.py script can also help generate/configure this.

# --- Django Core Settings ---
# IMPORTANT: Generate a new, strong secret key for your actual .env file.
# The start_dev.py script can generate one for you automatically if .env doesn't exist.
# Example: openssl rand -base64 48
SECRET_KEY='your_development_secret_key_please_change_me'

# DEBUG should be True for local development to see error pages and enable auto-reloading.
DEBUG=True

# Allowed hosts for the development server.
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost

# Django settings module. 'waterlab.settings' is typically the main/development settings.
# 'waterlab.settings_production' is for production.
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=waterlab.settings


# --- Database Configuration ---
# By default, local development will use SQLite for simplicity.
# The database file 'db.sqlite3' will be created in your project root.
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3

# If you want to use PostgreSQL for local development, uncomment and configure the line below.
# Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and a database created.
# You'll also need to install psycopg2-binary: pip install psycopg2-binary
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://YOUR_DB_USER:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DB_NAME
# Example: DATABASE_URL=postgres://waterlab_dev_user:dev_password@localhost:5432/waterlab_dev_db


# --- Email Configuration (for development) ---
# For local development, it's often easiest to have emails printed to the console.
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend

# If you want to test with a real SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, Mailtrap), configure these:
# EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
# EMAIL_PORT=587
# EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
# EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@example.com
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
# DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdevdomain.com


# --- Redis Configuration (Optional for local development) ---
# If your application uses Redis for caching or sessions, and you have Redis running locally.
# If not configured, Django might fall back to other session/cache backends or not use them.
# Check waterlab/settings.py for how caching and sessions are configured.
# REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 # Use database 0 for local dev


# --- Other Application-Specific Settings (Add as needed) ---
# Example:
# API_KEY_THIRD_PARTY=your_api_key_for_local_testing


# --- Production-Specific Variables (Commented out for local development) ---
# The following variables are typically used in production and are taken from .env.example.
# They are commented out here as they are not usually needed or should have different values for local dev.

# DOMAIN_NAME=localhost
# SERVER_IP=127.0.0.1
# USE_POSTGRESQL=false # Set to true if you uncomment DATABASE_URL for postgres above
# ADMIN_URL=admin/ # Default Django admin URL for local dev
# USE_SSL=false
# SENTRY_DSN=
# BACKUP_LOCATION=
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
# AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=
