# This file lists essential packages for local development.
# For a full list including production dependencies, see requirements.txt.

# Core Django framework
Django>=5.2,<5.3

# For parsing DATABASE_URL from .env file (used in settings.py)
dj-database-url>=2.1.0

# For managing environment variables from .env file (used in settings.py)
python-decouple>=3.8

# For PDF generation (likely essential for LIMS reports)
reportlab>=4.0.0

# Uncomment and install if you plan to use PostgreSQL for local development.

# which does not require psycopg2-binary.

# Uncomment and install if you intend to use Redis for caching or sessions
# during local development. The application can run without Redis for basic
# functionality if Redis is not configured in your local .env file.
# redis>=4.5.0
